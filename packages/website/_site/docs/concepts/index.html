  <h3>Board</h3>
<p>A <em>board</em> is an executable program, expressed declaratively as a graph. Boards
are analogous to a traditional program.</p>
<h3>Nodes</h3>
<p>A <em>node</em> is a step in a board that performs some action. This might be calling
an external API, or executing some local computation. Nodes are analogous to
functions in traditional programs.</p>
<h3>Ports</h3>
<p>A <em>port</em> is a named input or output of a node. Nodes can have any number of
ports. Ports can be <em>source ports</em> (data flows <em>out</em>), or <em>destination ports</em>
(data flows <em>in</em>). Source ports are analogous to the parameters of a traditional
function. Destination ports are analogous to the results returned by a
traditional function.</p>
<h3>Edges</h3>
<p>An <em>edge</em> is a connection between two ports through which data flows. Edges are
analogous to variables in a traditional program.</p>
<h4>Optional edges</h4>
<p>Edges can be <em>optional</em>, which means that the execution of a node will not wait
for data to be present before proceeding with execution.</p>
<h4>Constant edges</h4>
<p>Edges can be <em>constant</em>, which means the most recent object that flowed through
the edge will remain available indefinitely, instead of being destructively
consumed.</p>
<h3>Kits</h3>
<p>A <em>kit</em> is a library that exports node constructors. It is analogous to a
traditional library.</p>
<h3>Slots</h3>
<p>Boards can have <em>slots</em>, which is Breadboard's way of expressing <em>inversion of
control</em>. When a board exposes a slot, it means that users of that board are
expected to provide an implementation for some portion of the graph themselves.</p>
<h3>JSON descriptor</h3>
<p>The canonical low-level serialization of a board is its <em>JSON descriptor</em>. This
format is described by <a href="https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/blob/main/packages/breadboard/breadboard.schema.json">this JSON
schema</a>.
A Breadboard JSON descriptor is analogous to a compiled program, like a WASM or
ELF binary, though significantly more human-readable than those formats, and
typically containing much higher-level operations.</p>
<h3>Runtimes</h3>
<p>A <em>runtime</em> is a system that executes boards. Current runtimes include: Node,
Python, and Web.</p>
<h3>Frontends</h3>
<p>A <em>frontend</em> is a system that generates boards. Current frontends include the
<code>@google-labs/breadboard</code> API for Node, the Python <code>breadboard</code> library, and the
Breadboard Visual Playground. Boards can also be written by hand directly as
JSON, but using a frontend is typically easier.</p>
<p>Note that frontends are never coupled to a specific runtime. Boards generated by
the Node API can be executed by the Python runtime, and vice-versa.</p>
