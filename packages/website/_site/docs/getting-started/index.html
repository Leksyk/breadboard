  <p>Breadboard supports authoring in JavaScript/TypeScript and Python (coming soon).</p>
<h2>Set up</h2>
<p>Ensure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> version 18 or higher:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node -v
v21.2.0
</code></pre>
<p>Create a new workspace:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir my-breadboard
cd my-breadboard
git init # Optional
npm init
</code></pre>
<p>Install the following packages from npm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm i @google-labs/breadboard @google-labs/core-kit @google-labs/breadboard-cli
</code></pre>
<p><code>@google-labs/breadboard</code> is the main library used for building and running
boards. <code>@google-labs/core-kit</code> contains operations that almost every board
needs. <code>@google-labs/breadboard-cli</code> lets you run and build breadboards
directly from the command-line.</p>
<h2>Run your first board</h2>
<p>Make a new file called <code>hello.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;nodes&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;input-1&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;input&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;output-1&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;output&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;edges&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;from&quot;: &quot;input-1&quot;,
      &quot;out&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
      &quot;to&quot;: &quot;output-1&quot;,
      &quot;in&quot;: &quot;hear&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run it with the Breadboard CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npx breadboard run hello.json --input '{&quot;say&quot;:&quot;Hello World!&quot;}'
</code></pre>
<p>You should see this printed to your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{ &quot;hear&quot;: &quot;Hello&quot; }
</code></pre>
<h3>What's going on?</h3>
<p>The JSON file you created above is an example of a <em>board</em>. Boards are programs
which can be executed by Breadboard <em>runtimes</em>. The <code>breadboard run</code> command
uses the Breadboard JavaScript runtime to execute the board.</p>
<p>This example is a trivial board that just takes some text input and displays it.
We do this by creating an <em>input node</em>, an <em>output node</em>, and wiring the two
together with an <em>edge</em>.</p>
<h3>What's a node? What's an edge?</h3>
<p><em>Nodes</em> are the basic building blocks of a board. Nodes are the logical &quot;steps&quot;
of the program. Nodes perform work, like calling an API, doing some computation,
receiving some user input, or displaying some output. They are similar to
functions in other programming environments.</p>
<p>Nodes have <em>types</em> which determine how they behave. Breadboard comes with some
basic node types (like <code>input</code> and <code>output</code>). You can easily make your own node
types, and you can import them from libraries called <em>kits</em> (explained later).</p>
<p><em>Edges</em> are the connections between nodes along which data can flow. However,
because nodes often take multiple inputs and produce multiple outputs, edges are
more precisely connections between node <em>ports</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ports</em> are the named inputs and outputs of a node. When data flows <em>into</em> a
node, the port is called a <em>destination</em> port, and is similar to the parameters
of a function. When data flows <em>out</em> of a node, the port is called a <em>source</em>
port, and is similar to function return values. Some nodes have predefined
ports, others (like <code>input</code> and <code>output</code>), create their ports automatically when
an edge is created.</p>
<h2>Generating boards with JavaScript</h2>
<p>Typically you won't be writing boards directly as JSON by hand like we did
above, you'll instead write a program in JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python
(coming soon!) which <em>generates</em> the board. This gives you access to APIs which
are much easier to work with than writing JSON by hand.</p>
<p>Here's how to generate an equivalent board using the Breadboard JavaScript API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { base, recipe } from &quot;@google-labs/breadboard&quot;;

export default await recipe(() =&gt; {
  const input = base.input({});
  const output = base.output({});
  input.say.to(output.hear);
  return output;
}).serialize();
</code></pre>
<p>This JavaScript file can be compiled with the Breadboard CLI, producing a very
similar JSON file to what we wrote above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npx breadboard make hello.js
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can just run it directly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npx breadboard run hello.js --input '{&quot;say&quot;:&quot;Hello World!&quot;}'
</code></pre>
<h3>What's going on?</h3>
<p>We call <code>recipe</code> to declare a new board:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">recipe(() =&gt; {
  // ...
});
</code></pre>
<p>These lines create two nodes within that board:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const input = base.input({});
const output = base.output({});
</code></pre>
<p>This line creates an edge that connects the <code>input</code> node's <code>say</code> source port to
the <code>output</code> node's <code>hear</code> destination port:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// +----------------------- input node
// |   +------------------- source port
// |   |       +----------- output node
// |   |       |     +----- destination port
// |   |       |     |
input.say.to(output.hear);
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, this line converts the board to the common JSON format and exports it
from the JavaScript module, as expected by the Breadboard CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">await recipe(() =&gt; { ... }).serialize();
</code></pre>
